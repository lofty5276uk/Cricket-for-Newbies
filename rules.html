          <p class="para-format"> You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out, and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When they are all out, the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out.
            When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who stay out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out. When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game
            In cricket, there are always two teams and 22 players
            
            In the game of cricket, two teams compete against one
            another. Both of these teams have 11 players each on the field. Of these 11
            players, one player is the captain of the team. It is the captain of the team
            who has the primary responsibility of ensuring that at any given point, there
            are not more than 11 players in the field.
            
            Ruling of the umpire is final
            
            At any time, if a player does not fall the directions of the
            umpire, or balks at the decision of the umpire, he will be turned over to the
            captain of the team for either immediate dismissal or any other disciplinary
            action.
            
            Every six balls make an over
            
            There
            are six balls in every over, wherein the bowler will bowl the ball to the
            striker. The striker might either hit or miss the ball, and irrespective of it,
            it would be regarded as a completed ball. Once all the six balls are delivered,
            it would be called a completed over.
