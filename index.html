      <h2 class="section-header">The Wonderful Game Of Cricket.</h2>
      <p class="para-format"> The game of cricket is played around the world in cities, parks and beaches. Cricket clubs, schools and universities take part competitively and there are professional teams in many countries.

        However, this is only a brief glimpse of the sport – there’s so much more interesting information you need to learn. Here’s our complete guide to cricket for beginners.
        
        Aim of the game
        In order to win, one team has to score more ‘runs’ than the other team. A game of cricket can end as a draw, but this depends on the length of the match and pre-agreed rules.
        
        There are two teams, usually containing 11 players each, who take it in turns to be the fielding or batting side. 
        
        When a side is batting, only two players bat at one time, while the rest of the team wait to bat on the sidelines. When a team is fielding, all 11 players take to the field.
        
        A game of cricket is divided into ‘innings’, the period in which one team takes its turn to bat. Each innings consists of a predetermined number of ‘overs’. An over is a set of six consecutive deliveries bowled from one end of a cricket pitch to another.

       The aim of the fielding side is to get each batsman ‘out’, one at a time, with each dismissal known as a ‘wicket’. The batsman then leaves the field of play and a new batsman takes their place.

       The goal of the fielding team is to take all ten wickets. As a cricket team is made up of 11 players and you can only take one wicket at a time, there’s always a batsman who’s ‘not out’ at the end of the innings.

       Competitive formats
       Cricket matches take different lengths of time to complete, depending on their format.

       In the professional arena, Test cricket is the sport’s oldest and longest format and is considered the highest standard due to its length. It lasts up to five days, with two innings per team. There are also shorter, ‘limited-overs’ formats of between 20 and 50 overs per innings.

       The first Test match took place in 1877 and was contested by England and Australia. In 1882, Australia triumphed for the first time, leading to the creation of the Ashes.

       Key positions explained
       Here’s a breakdown of the different positions on the field and what each position entails…

       Batsman
       There are two batsmen directly involved at any one time and their role is to score as many runs as possible. If their team is batting first, the goal is to score the largest total possible. If they are batting second, it’s all about trying to surpass the opposition’s score. 

       Bowler
       There can only be one bowler from the fielding side at any one time, and they bowl their over at the batsman.

       A bowler cannot bowl concurrent overs from different ends. They must have a break and wait until the end they wish to bowl from is available again.

       There are different types of bowlers, depending on how they grip the ball, the speed they deliver it and the pitch conditions:

       Seam – A seam bowler will use the seam of the ball to deviate the ball off the pitch to out-think and dismiss the batsman.

       Spin – A spin bowler will use their fingers to ‘spin’ or rotate the ball through the air, so that it changes direction when it lands. Like so…
