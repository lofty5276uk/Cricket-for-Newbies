          <p class="para-format"> You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out, and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When they are all out, the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out.
            When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who stay out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out. When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game
            </p>
          <p class="para-format">In cricket, there are always two teams and
            22 players
            
            In the game of cricket, two teams compete against one
            another. Both of these teams have 11 players each on the field. Of these 11
            players, one player is the captain of the team. It is the captain of the team
            who has the primary responsibility of ensuring that at any given point, there
            are not more than 11 players in the field.
            
            Ruling of the umpire is final
            
            At any time, if a player does not fall the directions of the
            umpire, or balks at the decision of the umpire, he will be turned over to the
            captain of the team for either immediate dismissal or any other disciplinary
            action.
            
            Every six balls make an over
            
            There
            are six balls in every over, wherein the bowler will bowl the ball to the
            striker. The striker might either hit or miss the ball, and irrespective of it,
            it would be regarded as a completed ball. Once all the six balls are delivered,
            it would be called a completed over.  
            </p>
          <p class="para-format">So,
            after one over, the bowler will be changed, and now another team member or the
            bowler will come forward and throw the next over. Annie recollects her
            experience, saying that recently she and her boyfriend had to go for watching a
            live match in the stadium but had an assignment submission too. So, they
            decided to opt for statistics
            homework help by TAE,and in the meantime, her
            boyfriend explained to her all the rules so they could both fully enjoy the
            game in the stadium.  
            
            Duration of the game is negotiated
            
            At times, the two teams agree to play two innings and then
            accordingly limit the hours that they choose to spend on the field. Similarly,
            the teams can also agree on playing one inning but at a reduced number of
            overs. All of these decisions have to be taken ahead of the start of the game.
            
            Professional cricket matches are fixed
            duration games
            
            Though these matches are called the test matches, they go
            on for 6 hours every day for 5 days together. Moreover, since the matches need
            adequate natural light, the playtime is mostly set between 11:00 AM-6:00
            PM. 
            
            Batsman and bat both run for an over
            
            In
            the game of cricket, the batsman runs between the stumps along with the bat to
            complete the over. However, even if he is unable to finish the line, he can
            stretch via his bat to mark himself safe. Armaan, a professional tutor, working
            with TrumpLearning,says
            that he recently went to the stadium to see a match, and since it was his first
            time, it amused him to note this difference between baseball and cricket,
            where, in the former, the player tosses his bad aside when running from one
            point to another, wherein in cricket, the bat has to be with the batsman while
            running between the wickets.
            
            When the ball hits the fence of the
            boundary, it means four runs
            
            When a batsman hits the ball, and it straightaway hits
            the boundary, then the player gets four runs. However, if the ball goes beyond
            the boundary, then the player makes six runs.
            
            Overthrows could
            bring extra runs
            
            If the fielder is
            unable to throw back the ball, the batsman can continue making additional runs
            by running between the wickets. In case the ball rolls to the boundary, then
            the completed runs are added to the four runs earned by a boundary hit.
            
            Wasting any time on the field is penalized
            
            We all know that a game of cricket can last for days.
            However, to curtail any form of time wastage, a new batsman has to leave the
            game if he takes longer than 2 minutes to enter the field post the fall of the
            wicket.
            
            Field placement
            is an optional call
            
            The captain of the team may or may not choose a field position for the team
            members. It is an individual strategy and is done to best suit the team.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Batting</h2>
          <p class="para-format"> Always stand facing the bowler with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your body with your hips, keeping your back straight. As you hold the bat ready, point your non-dominant shoulder towards the bowler and make sure to keep your eyes on the ball. Your shoulders shouldn’t drop and must be at eye level at all times. If you are right-handed, you stand on the right side of the stump and if left-handed, you stand on the right side of the stump. 
            Hold the bat
            Always hold your bat tight and firmly. If you are right-handed, your left hand should be holding the end of the bat with the knuckles facing the bowler and your right hand should be placed above your left hand and hold the bat with 2 fingers and your thumb. Your thumb and the index finger should be in a V position for a better and a tighter grip. The opposite for left-handed batsmen. Make sure your hands are close to each other and the paddle of the bat should feel comfortable in your hands.  Draw a line in your turf from the middle wicket. This will help you to make sure where your wickets are while batting. Draw the line using your bat’s end and make sure that the line is parallel to the middle wicket. This line is called a guard line. If you are practising indoors, use tape to draw the guard line.
            If you tap on the guard line, this indicates the bowler that you are ready to bat. Do not tap excessively hard on the ground. Make sure your bat is as straight as possible at all times to maintain your body form. When the ball is coming at you and you have to hit it, always keep your lead leg in the front and swing your bat backward for momentum. While lifting your bat, it should point straight in the air and should come up till your back shoulder. If the ball is low, step forward to hit it and if it is high, step blackboard. Make sure that when you lift your bat to hit the ball, your forearm should line up with your shoulder.

            
            </p>
          <p class="para-format">Always, eye on the ball. If you follow the ball till it pitches, you can figure out the position you have to take to hit the ball. As the ball comes towards you, think about which shot to hit. If the ball pitches at a sweet spot, you can drive to take long shots but if the ball pitches too high or low, take a defence shot. This is one of the most important cricket batting techniques for beginners to remember and follow.

            Swing the bat downward
            Push your bat downward to hit the ball after it bounces. Keep your lead leg in the front and lead elbow facing the bowler. Follow through with your bat to hit the ball as far as possible. This cricket batting technique is the most common and is called a straight drive.
            
            Short Pitch
            Swing the bat to the side, if the pitch is short. If the ball bounces early, then it is known as a short pitch. Move backwards with your back foot to hit a long defensive swing. Swing the bat to the side like a baseball bat instead of swinging it directly down. This will make the ball go higher and longer. This shot is called a pull shot and will cause the ball to go to the side of the field. 
            
            If the ball is aimed at the wicket
            Make contact with the ball if it is aimed at the wicket. If the ball is fast and low, this means that it is mainly to hit your wicket and get you out. When this happens, you have to hit a straight drive as a defensive shot. But, this shot is not to make runs or score high, but to protect your wickets. Make sure that you hit your ball short by concentrating on the ball. 
            
            Follow-through
            You can refine your skills by following through with your swing. A good follow-through is critical. Make sure you follow through your bat for the whole swing even if you miss the ball. This is done to hit the ball as far as possible. Keep practising so that even if you miss the ball, you do not pop the ball in the air and get out easily.
