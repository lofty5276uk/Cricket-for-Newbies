          <p class="para-format"> You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out, and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When they are all out, the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out.
            When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who stay out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out. When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game
            In cricket, there are always two teams and 22 players
            
            In the game of cricket, two teams compete against one
            another. Both of these teams have 11 players each on the field. Of these 11
            players, one player is the captain of the team. It is the captain of the team
            who has the primary responsibility of ensuring that at any given point, there
            are not more than 11 players in the field.
            
            Ruling of the umpire is final
            
            At any time, if a player does not fall the directions of the
            umpire, or balks at the decision of the umpire, he will be turned over to the
            captain of the team for either immediate dismissal or any other disciplinary
            action.
            
            Every six balls make an over
            
            There
            are six balls in every over, wherein the bowler will bowl the ball to the
            striker. The striker might either hit or miss the ball, and irrespective of it,
            it would be regarded as a completed ball. Once all the six balls are delivered,
            it would be called a completed over.

        <h2 class="section-header">Batting.</h2>
        <p class="para-format"> Always stand facing the bowler with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your body with your hips, keeping your back straight. As you hold the bat ready, point your non-dominant shoulder towards the bowler and make sure to keep your eyes on the ball. Your shoulders shouldn’t drop and must be at eye level at all times. If you are right-handed, you stand on the right side of the stump and if left-handed, you stand on the right side of the stump. 
          Hold the bat. Always hold your bat tight and firmly. If you are right-handed, your left hand should be holding the end of the bat with the knuckles facing the bowler and your right hand should be placed above your left hand and hold the bat with 2 fingers and your thumb. Your thumb and the index finger should be in a V position for a better and a tighter grip. The opposite for left-handed batsmen. Make sure your hands are close to each other and the paddle of the bat should feel comfortable in your hands.  Draw a line in your turf from the middle wicket. This will help you to make sure where your wickets are while batting. Draw the line using your bat’s end and make sure that the line is parallel to the middle wicket. This line is called a guard line. If you are practising indoors, use tape to draw the guard line.
          If you tap on the guard line, this indicates the bowler that you are ready to bat. Do not tap excessively hard on the ground. Make sure your bat is as straight as possible at all times to maintain your body form. When the ball is coming at you and you have to hit it, always keep your lead leg in the front and swing your bat backward for momentum. While lifting your bat, it should point straight in the air and should come up till your back shoulder. If the ball is low, step forward to hit it and if it is high, step blackboard. Make sure that when you lift your bat to hit the ball, your forearm should line up with your shoulder.
          Always, eye on the ball. If you follow the ball till it pitches, you can figure out the position you have to take to hit the ball. As the ball comes towards you, think about which shot to hit. If the ball pitches at a sweet spot, you can drive to take long shots but if the ball pitches too high or low, take a defence shot. This is one of the most important cricket batting techniques for beginners to remember and follow.

          Swing the bat downward
          Push your bat downward to hit the ball after it bounces. Keep your lead leg in the front and lead elbow facing the bowler. Follow through with your bat to hit the ball as far as possible. This cricket batting technique is the most common and is called a straight drive.
          
          Short Pitch
          Swing the bat to the side, if the pitch is short. If the ball bounces early, then it is known as a short pitch. Move backwards with your back foot to hit a long defensive swing. Swing the bat to the side like a baseball bat instead of swinging it directly down. This will make the ball go higher and longer. This shot is called a pull shot and will cause the ball to go to the side of the field. 
          
          If the ball is aimed at the wicket
          Make contact with the ball if it is aimed at the wicket. If the ball is fast and low, this means that it is mainly to hit your wicket and get you out. When this happens, you have to hit a straight drive as a defensive shot. But, this shot is not to make runs or score high, but to protect your wickets. Make sure that you hit your ball short by concentrating on the ball. 
          
          Follow-through
          You can refine your skills by following through with your swing. A good follow-through is critical. Make sure you follow through your bat for the whole swing even if you miss the ball. This is done to hit the ball as far as possible. Keep practising so that even if you miss the ball, you do not pop the ball in the air and get out easily.

                    <h2 class="section-header">Bowling</h2>

                    <p class="para-format"> In cricket, is the action of propelling the ball toward the wicket defended by a batter. A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler; a bowler who is also a competent batter is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow. A single act of bowling the ball towards the batsman is called a ball or a delivery. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over. Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over from the other end of the pitch.  The Laws of Cricket govern how a ball must be bowled.  If a ball is bowled illegally, an umpire will rule it a no-ball. If a ball is bowled too wide of the striker for the batsman to be able to play at it with a proper cricket shot, the bowler's end umpire will rule it a wide.
          
                      There are different types of bowlers, from fast bowlers, whose primary weapon is pace, through swing and seam bowlers who try to make the ball deviate in its course through the air or when it bounces, to slow bowlers, who will attempt to deceive the batter with a variety of flight and spin. A spin bowler usually delivers the ball quite slowly and puts spin on the ball, causing it to turn at an angle while bouncing off the pitch.[8]
                      
                      A team can be said to have elected to "have a bowl" when it wins the coin toss and chooses to field.

                    <p class="para-format">Fielding in the sport of cricket is the action of fielders in collecting the ball after it is struck by the batsman, to limit the number of runs that the batsman scores and/or to get the batsman out by catching the ball in flight or by running the batsman out. There are a number of recognised fielding positions, and they can be categorised into the offside and leg side of the field. Fielding generally involves preventing the ball from going to or over the edge of the field (which would count as a boundary), and getting the ball to either wicket as quickly as possible.
                       A fielder or fieldsman may field the ball with any part of his body. However, if while the ball is in play he wilfully fields it otherwise (e.g. by using his hat), the ball becomes dead and five penalty runs are awarded to the batting side, unless the ball previously struck a batsman not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. Most of the rules covering fielders are in Law 28 of the Laws of cricket.
