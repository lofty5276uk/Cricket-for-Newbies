          <p class="para-format"> The game of cricket is played around the world in cities, parks and beaches. Cricket
            clubs, schools and universities take part competitively and there are professional teams in many countries.
            However, this is only a brief glimpse of the sport – there’s so much more interesting information you need
            to learn. Here’s our complete guide to cricket for beginners.

          <p class="para-format">Aim of the game
            In order to win, one team has to score more ‘runs’ than the other team. A game of cricket can end as a draw,
            but this depends on the length of the match and pre-agreed rules.
            There are two teams, usually containing 11 players each, who take it in turns to be the fielding or batting
            side.
            When a side is batting, only two players bat at one time, while the rest of the team wait to bat on the
            sidelines. When a team is fielding, all 11 players take to the field.
            A game of cricket is divided into ‘innings’, the period in which one team takes its turn to bat. Each
            innings consists of a predetermined number of ‘overs’. An over is a set of six consecutive deliveries bowled
            from one end of a cricket pitch to another.
            The aim of the fielding side is to get each batsman ‘out’, one at a time, with each dismissal known as a
            ‘wicket’. The batsman then leaves the field of play and a new batsman takes their place.
            The goal of the fielding team is to take all ten wickets. As a cricket team is made up of 11 players and you
            can only take one wicket at a time, there’s always a batsman who’s ‘not out’ at the end of the innings.</p>

          <p class="para-format">Competitive formats:
            Cricket matches take different lengths of time to complete, depending on their format.
            In the professional arena, Test cricket is the sport’s oldest and longest format and is considered the
            highest standard due to its length. It lasts up to five days, with two innings per team. There are also
            shorter, ‘limited-overs’ formats of between 20 and 50 overs per innings.
            The first Test match took place in 1877 and was contested by England and Australia. In 1882, Australia
            triumphed for the first time, leading to the creation of the Ashes.</p>

          <p class="para-format">
            Here’s a breakdown of the different positions on the field and what each position entails…</p>

          <p class="para-format">
            Batsman:
            There are two batsmen directly involved at any one time and their role is to score as many runs as possible.
            If their team is batting first, the goal is to score the largest total possible. If they are batting second,
            it’s all about trying to surpass the opposition’s score.</p>

          <p class="para-format">
            Bowler:
            There can only be one bowler from the fielding side at any one time, and they bowl their over at the
            batsman.
            A bowler cannot bowl concurrent overs from different ends. They must have a break and wait until the end
            they wish to bowl from is available again.</p>

          <p class="para-format">
            Fielder:
            In simple terms, fielding refers to the act of catching, collecting and returning a ball that’s hit by the
            batsman.
            In cricket, there’s a bowler and ten other fielders, one of whom is nominated a ‘wicket-keeper’ and stands
            behind the batsman’s wicket.
            A wicket-keeper wears protective pads and gloves and can get a batsman out in a number of ways. They can
            achieve a catch (if the ball doesn’t bounce), a ‘stumping’ if the batsman leaves their ground, or a ‘run
            out’ if a batsman attempts a run but doesn’t complete it in time.</p>

          <p class="para-format">
            Umpire:
            These are the two officials who make on-field decisions. One stands behind the stumps at the end the bowler
            is delivering the over from, while the other stands at a fielding position known as Square Leg. This
            position is at a right angle to the batsman.
            At the next over, the Square-Leg umpire moves to stand behind the stumps at the new end and vice-versa.</p>

          <p class="para-format">
            Scorer:
            There are usually two scorers, one for each team. They note the overall team totals, individual batting
            scores and other aspects of the game such as who’s bowling and who takes catches.
            Scorers will either use a paper scorebook to keep track of each innings, or ‘score’ the match using an
            electronic device such as a laptop. This enables ‘live scores’ to be seen over the Internet.</p>

    <!-- Terminology explained -->

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 text-property">


          <p class="para-format">Key terminology explained:
            We briefly touched on innings and overs above. Let’s look at these and more key cricket terms in detail…

            Over:
            An ‘over’ lasts six legitimate balls. It’s delivered over-arm by the bowler, who must bounce the ball once
            before it reaches the batsman, who needs to stands 22 yards away.
            When six balls are completed, the umpire will call ‘Over’ and the action will always swap ends. A new over
            will start and a new bowler delivers six balls.</p>

      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 text-property">


          <p class="para-format">Innings:
            This is the period in which a team bats and the fielding side must try to get 10 wickets. Once they do this,
            or the number of overs runs out, the innings will come to an end.
            A game of cricket can either be one or two innings each, depending on if it’s being played by professionals
            who play for longer (two innings).</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 text-property">

          <p class="para-format">Run:
            A batting total is measured in runs and different quantities of runs can be scored off each ball. A batsman
            can hit the ball in the air over the boundary for six runs, or along the ground for four runs.
            In addition, if a batsman hits the ball and is not given ‘out’ (i.e. by being caught by a fielder), the pair
            can complete as many runs as they can manage.
            A single, completed run is counted if both batsmen swap ends and are safely in their ground (defined with
            white lines marked on the surface).</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 text-property">


          <p class="para-format">Wicket:
            A ‘wicket’ can relate to two things. Either, the three wooden stumps in the ground on which two bails rest,
            which a batsman stands in front of. Or, when a batsman is dismissed, i.e. he has lost his wicket.</p>

          <p class="para-format">In:
            Batting in cricket is centred around the idea of being ‘in’ or ‘out’. A batsman is ‘in’ for the period of
            their personal innings.</p>

          <p class="para-format">Out:
            The notion of being ‘out’ is when one of the two batsmen is dismissed. Only one batsman is dismissed at a
            time and this can happen in a variety of ways.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 text-property">

          <p class="para-format">There are two common ways you can be caught out. Either, if a batsman hits the ball in
            the air, or if a fielder catches the ball without it being grounded.
            A batsman is also deemed out if he or she is ‘bowled’ which is when the bowler manages to hit the stumps and
            dislodge at least one of the bails on top.
            A third mode of dismissal is to be adjudged by the umpire to be ‘LBW’, or leg before wicket. This means a
            batsman has illegally stopped the ball hitting the stumps by being hit on the pads or body.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 text-property">

          <p class="para-format"> The laws regarding LBW can seem tricky for beginners to grasp. However, in a nutshell,
            a batsman is out if a) the ball doesn’t hit the bat and b) the ball hits the pads or body in line with the
            stumps.
            A batsman can also be out LBW if the ball has pitched on the ‘off-side’ and was judged to be going on to hit
            the stumps, if a batsman isn’t deemed to have played a shot.
            A batsman cannot be given out LBW if the ball first pitches on leg-side, even if it’s obviously going on to
            hit the stumps.
