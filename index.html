        <p>In cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the ball with a bat to score runs and prevent the loss of one's wicket. Any player who is currently batting is denoted as a batsman, batswoman, or batter, regardless of whether batting is their particular area of expertise.</p>

        <img class="bowling-image" src="assets/images/ball.jpg">
        <p> Bowling in cricket refers to when a player - 'the bowler' - propels the ball towards the stumps that a batsman is defending. In terms of objectives, bowlers aim to either take wickets (the act of dismissing batsmen by hitting the stumps with the ball) or to prevent run scoring opportunities.</p>

        <img class="fielding-image" src="assets/images/Fielding.jpg">
        <p> Fielding in the sport of cricket is the action of fielders in collecting the ball after it is struck by the batsman, to limit the number of runs that the batsman scores and/or to get the batsman out by catching the ball in flight or by running the batsman out. There are a number of recognised fielding positions, and they can be categorised into the offside and leg side of the field. Fielding generally involves preventing the ball from going to or over the edge of the field (which would count as a boundary), and getting the ball to either wicket as quickly as possible.</p>
