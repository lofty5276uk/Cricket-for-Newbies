![cricket-in-the-park-glenford-john](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83220570/125708983-68948da6-261a-4d26-91b8-d510b274bbde.jpg)



## **Aims of this project**

This is Cricket For Newbies!
Having spent 27 years playing cricket around the assets/images/cricket.png country it amazed me the amount of people who were interested in playing cricket but had no idea where to start.
This website has been designed to help those people to start playing the game I love even 6 years after i retired!!!!

I have designed this information packed website to make it easy reading as cricket is not the easiest game to learn.

Any Feedback or queries head over to my Github contact details and please leave any information you see fit too

## **UX**
<a></a>
### **User Goals**

* A website that is easy to navigate on different devices.  I decided on a basic bootstrap navbar to make the user experience as easy as possible.

* Content that is meaningful and catches the eye
* Easy on the eye in terms of content colour and layout

### **User Stories**

* As a user I want the website to provide the information I require without me having to click on too many buttons
* As a user I want a choice of websites should I choose to continue my investigations.

* As a user I want a website that is visually stimulating

#### Fonts
I have used Google Fonts and the Robot font range to keep the text looking clear and simple.

<a></a>
#### Logo
I created my logo using https://www.photopea.com/ to keep it inline with the theme of the website.

<a></a>
#### Icons
I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). The icons used are in tune with the external links on the webpage.

<a></a>
#### Colors
As I decided not to overload the webpage with colors I kept them simple using standard colours in Gitpod.

<a></a>
#### Structure
I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS.[markdown-cheat-sheet.md](https://github.com/lofty5276uk/Cricket-for-Newbies/files/6784916/markdown-cheat-sheet.md)

#### WireFrames 

I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes for my project

### **Existing Features**

#### Navigation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83220570/126987789-7dd0c224-9a72-4052-986d-8b85859a7707.png)
I used Bootstrap to create my navbar and then styled so its easy viewing and easy to use for all users. Controlled using a Burger icon

I fixed the Nav Bar to the top so users can easily navigate the site from whichever section they are in. This negates the need to put in 'back to top' links which could break user experience. 

## **Testing**

<a></a>

### **Approach and Tools**

I deployed my website later then planned due to me needing to fully understand the whole process involved. this was achieved with no end of help from the slack community as well as my mentor.

Once I had the structure in place, I began testing across other devices. I checked that the menu as well as the embeded vidoes worked and showed correctly across all devices. 

Finally, I asked my wife to test the website on her mobile device. I asked her to make a note of anything they found didnt work or from a design purpose didnt like the look of This proved particularly helpful for user stories and when considering future features.

### **Validator Testing**
* HTML
    * No errors were returned when passing through [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

* CSS
    * No errors were returned when passing through [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

<a></a>

### **Bugs and Solutions**

* Hero Image
    I had issues where the hero image would show twice when looking the batting.html page this was easily solved by adding no-repeat 
   
  * *Verdict* - Image now shows as expected on all browsers.

* Hamburger dropdown menu
    no known bugs found worked on all devices.
